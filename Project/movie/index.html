        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Film, also called movie or motion picture, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that 
          communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere, by the means of recorded or 
          programmed[vague] moving images, along with sound (and more rarely) other sensory stimulations. The word "cinema",
           short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, 
          and to the art form that is the result of it.</p>

        <p>The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, 
          by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, 
          or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector
          onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, 
          and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack 
          (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion
           of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

          Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. 
          They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is
           considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for 
           educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some
            films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into 
            other languages.</p>

          <p>The individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter 
            causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the 
            interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of 
            a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon</p>
