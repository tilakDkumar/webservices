  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The first railway on Indian sub-continent ran over a stretch of 21 miles from Bombay to Thane. The idea of a
     railway to connect Bombay with Thane, Kalyan and with the Thal and Bhore Ghats inclines first occurred to Mr. 
     George Clark, the Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government, during a visit to Bhandup in 1843.

    The formal inauguration ceremony was performed on 16th April 1853, when 14 railway carriages carrying about 400 guests left Bori
     Bunder at 3.30 pm "amidst the loud applause of a vast multitude and to the salute of 21 guns." The first passenger train steamed
      out of Howrah station destined for Hooghly, a distance of 24 miles, on 15th August, 1854. Thus the first section of the East Indian
       Railway was opened to public traffic, 
    inaugurating the beginning of railway transport on the Eastern side of the subcontinent.</p>

                <p>In south the first line was opened on Ist July, 1856 by the Madras Railway Company. It ran between Vyasarpadi Jeeva Nilayam (Veyasarpandy) and Walajah Road (Arcot), a distance of 63 miles. In the North a length of 119 miles of line was laid from Allahabad to Kanpur on 
                3rd March 1859. The first section from Hathras Road to Mathura Cantonment was opened to traffic on 19th October, 1875.

                These were the small’s beginnings which is due course developed into a network of railway lines all over the country. By 
                1880 the Indian Railway system had a route mileage of about 9000 miles. INDIAN RAILWAYS, the premier transport organization of the 
                country is the largest rail network in Asia and the world’s second largest under one management..</p>

              <h3>National Rail Vikas Yojana</h3>
              <p>With a view to complete strategically important projects within a stipulated period of time, a non-budgetary 
                investment initiative for the development of Railways has been launched.. Under the scheme all the capacity bottlenecks in the
                 critical sections of the railway network will be removed at an investment of Rs.15,000 crore over the next five years. 
                These projects would include</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Strengthening of the golden Quadrilateral to run more long-distance mail/express and freight trains at a higher speed of 100 kmph</li>

                  <li>Strengthening of rail connectivity to ports and development of multi-modal corridors to hinterland.
                  </li>
                  <li>Construction of four mega bridges - two over River Ganga, one over River Brahmaputra, and one over River Kos</li>
                  <li>Accelerated completion of those projects nearing completion and other important projects</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>New Steps towards Safety and Security </h3>
                <p>Safety of 13 million passengers that Indian Railways serve every day is of paramount importance to the system. Over the years,
                   apart from the regular safety norms followed, the network has taken a number of steps through innovative use of technology and 
                   stepped up training to its manpower to enhance safety standards. Constitution of Rs.17,000 crore non-lapsable Special Railway 
                   Safety Fund (SRSF) to replace the arrears of aging assets of Railways over the next six years has been a historical move in this
                    direction. A number of distressed bridges, old tracks, signalling system and other safety enhancement devices will be replaced 
                    during this period. As far as budget allocation for safety is concerned, Rs.1,400 crore was allocated in the revised estimate for
                     the year 2001-02 and Rs.2,210 crore for the year 2002-2003. Extensive field trials of the Anti-Collision Device (ACD), 
                     indigenously developed by Konkan Railway, is going on and once deployed across the Zonal Railways, 
                  this innovative technology will help railways reduce accidents due to collision between trains</p>

                  <h4>Tie-Up with Foreign Railways </h4>
                  <p>Indian Railways is in constant touch with Railways across the world to bring in state-of-art facilities in its system.
                     Towards this, a Memorandum of Understanding was singed during the Eighth Session of the Indo-Austria Joint Economic Commission
                      held in Vienna. This seeks to promote and deepen long-term infrastructure-specific cooperation between Indian and Austrian Railways
                       to their mutual benefit.A three-day International Conference of Union of Railways was organised by Indian Railways in New Delhi in which hundreds of delegates 
                    from various industries and Railways around the world participated.</p>
